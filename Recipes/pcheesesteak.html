      <li>
        <p>
          Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak, bell pepper, and
          onion. Cook until steak is hot and reaches your desired color, 7 to 10
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch
          baking pan with aluminum foil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Slice the connected rolls in half widthwise to look like 2 giant
          slices of bread. Place the bottom half into the bottom of the prepared
          baking pan. Spread mayonnaise evenly on top.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place 4 slices of pepper Jack cheese over the mayonnaise. Layer the
          steak mixture and the remaining cheese on top. Cover with the top half
          of the bread. Spread melted butter on top.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread is
          browned, about 20 minutes. Slice into individual portions.
